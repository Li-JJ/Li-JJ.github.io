Everyone loves going out and discovering new places. A lot of us have our secret or special places, where we like to go with our friends, like a place with a stunning view, place in woods, your rooftop, places in your neighbourhood... Unfortunately, not many of those places can be found on Foursquare, because they are somewhat special. 
</p>
<p align="center">
 I doubt that you can learn about a way to sneak into a club on Foursquare, or a way to get on the roof of the highest building in the city you are visiting. Our platform will help people share their favourite places with others and find out about awesome places and locations by themselves. Future perspective is to add events on that map, like local parties at someone's home, or just friendly gatherings to go out and have fun.
