The key concepts from the theory of parallel algorithms are discussed. Parallel Matrix Multiplication and Merge Sort algorithms on ideal parallel computer are analyzed and implemented using various technologies and libraries for both: shared and distributed memory models. In addition, the problem of designing thread-safe data structures at the example of stack data structure is considered.
