---
**It often happens that we do not have enough time to read messages. With this app, we will be able to read and receive messages more easily.**
  
Let me read that for you - is an android app that helps to read any received notification using a speed reading technique.
It displays the text in the center of the screen so it is convenient to use it for accessibility in case of poor eyesight and also economs time on going through notifications.

Speed reading technology is called spritz, the app is developed by capturing the mobile sensors.
