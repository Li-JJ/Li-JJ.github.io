    My research interests are in machine learning and natural language processing (sentiment analysis, recommender systems, next word prediction).\\n
    My master’s thesis was about a recommender system for emojis. \\n
I was an intern at Google Maps and Google Search teams, DeepMind and Facebook. I will spend Spring’20 at Twitter. \\n
Before graduate school, I received Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from Tbilisi State University. Where I got involved in research by doing a project in ‘modeling with partial differential equations’. My bachelor’s thesis was about ‘Implementation and Analysis of Parallel Algorithms’. ",
